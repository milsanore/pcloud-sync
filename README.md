# PCLOUD SYNC
- pcloud's lifetime plan is awesome, but their sync sucks
- for example, if you have a large folder of photos
- you can create a fixed sync (probably a better idea), or you can run a script to get all files (this)

# RUN
- copy `sync` to your pcloud drive root directory
- in a terminal run `.\sync`
- it will take a long time as it downloads all files
