# PCLOUD SYNC
pcloud's lifetime plan is awesome, but their sync sucks.
this simple script triggers the download of all the files in the script's folder.

# RUN
- copy `sync.ps1` to your pcloud drive root directory
- in a terminal run `.\sync.ps1`
- it will take a long time as it downloads all files
